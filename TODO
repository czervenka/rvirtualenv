* run_command cleanup and tests


--------------------

* test for install with pip and not uninstalling
  some sys (previous venv) package

* test for building something binary


--------------------

* virtualenv inheritance
  if you create one venv inside another it should take precedence
  not ready yet, try:
    ./rvirtualenv.py PY1
    source PY1/bin/activate
    ./rvirtualenv.py PY2
    ./PY2/bin/python -c "import rvirtualenvkeep; print(rvirtualenvkeep.__file__)"
  it should return rvirtualenvkeep from PY2
  .. i repaired this one, but sys.path is ugly sometimes now..


--------------------

* investigate and improve site.py execution

* what if there are more venvs on pythonpath

* add some testcase with easy_install

* docs improvement with @carljm

* ...
